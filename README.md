# Deep learning for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery

This repository contains the code of my Bachelor's thesis: **Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery**. The code provides an implementation for training and evaluating semantic segmentation models on the Corine Land Cover dataset. It currently supports DeepLabV3+ and U-Net segmentation architectures.

### Usage

1.  **Configuration:** Edit the `config.yaml` file to define the desired parameters for training or evaluating the models.

2.  **Train:** Run `python src/train.py` to train a model.

3.  **Evaluate:** Run `python src/evaluate.py` to evaluate the trained model.
